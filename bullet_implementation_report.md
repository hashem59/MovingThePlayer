# Technical Report: Bullet Implementation in Robot Dodge

## Bullet Modeling and Physics

The bullet system is implemented as a separate `Bullet` class that encapsulates all bullet-related functionality. Each bullet is modeled with the following properties:

- Position (`_x`, `_y`): Tracks the bullet's current location
- Velocity (`_velocity`): A Vector2D that determines the bullet's movement direction and speed
- Constants:
  - `SPEED`: 8.0 units per update
  - `RADIUS`: 5 pixels for collision detection

## Bullet Creation and Initialization

Bullets are created in response to player input (left mouse click) in the `RobotDodge.HandleInput()` method. The creation process involves:

1. Spawning from the player's center position
2. Calculating initial velocity based on the mouse click position
3. Using vector mathematics to determine direction:
   - Creates a unit vector from player to target
   - Multiplies by constant speed to set velocity

## Movement System

The bullet movement system is implemented through:

1. A velocity-based update system in `Bullet.Update()`
2. Position updates using simple vector addition: `_x += _velocity.X; _y += _velocity.Y`
3. Automatic cleanup when bullets go offscreen (implemented in `RobotDodge.Update()`)

## Collision Detection and Robot Destruction

The collision system uses circle-based collision detection:

1. Each bullet has a circular collision area defined by its position and radius
2. Robots have their own collision circle (20-pixel radius centered on their position)
3. Collision detection is handled by `Bullet.CollidedWith(Robot robot)` using SplashKit's `CirclesIntersect` function

The destruction process is managed by the `RobotDodge` class:

1. Maintains lists of active bullets and robots
2. Checks for collisions between all bullets and robots
3. When a collision is detected:
   - Both the bullet and robot are marked for removal
   - They are removed from their respective lists in the next update cycle

## Memory Management

The system implements efficient memory management:

1. Bullets are automatically removed when they go offscreen
2. Collided bullets and robots are removed from their respective lists
3. Uses `List<T>.ToArray()` when iterating over collections that will be modified during iteration to prevent collection modification errors

## Integration with Game Loop

The bullet system is fully integrated into the game's main loop:

1. Input handling for bullet creation
2. Position updates during the update phase
3. Collision detection and resolution
4. Rendering of active bullets

This implementation provides a robust and efficient bullet system that integrates well with the existing game architecture while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
